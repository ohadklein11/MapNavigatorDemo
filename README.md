## Overview

This demo showcases an advanced navigation system that delivers a comprehensive driving experience with intelligent route management:

‚Ä¢ **Smart Location Detection** - Estimates your current location based on IP address  
‚Ä¢ **Dynamic Map Loading** - Auto-loads new map tiles from OpenStreetMap based on visibility  
‚Ä¢ **Optimal Route Calculation** - Calculates optimal routes from current position to target using OSRM  
‚Ä¢ **Realistic Driving Simulation** - Simulates realistic driving including off-route scenarios with automatic detection and recalculation

## How to Use

### **Navigation**
Left-click and hold to drag the map, double-click to set a target destination

### **Simulation** 
Use the interface buttons to start and control the drive simulation

### **Settings**
Click the settings button (top right) to:
- Change point of view (POV)
- Hide route recalculation popups
- Show debug points

### **Off-Route Testing**
Adjust the randomization slider to control simulation going off-route. The system will automatically detect deviations and recalculate new routes

### **Reset**
Double-click at any time to stop the current simulation and set a new target
