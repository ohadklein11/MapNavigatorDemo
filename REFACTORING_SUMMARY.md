# Route System Refactoring - Event-Driven Architecture

## Summary

This refactoring implements a proper event-driven architecture where the RouteSimulator responds to events from the RouteManager/Navigator instead of being directly controlled by them. This creates better separation of concerns and follows the single responsibility principle.

## Changes Made

### 1. RouteManager Changes

**Removed Direct RouteSimulator Control:**
- Removed `RouteSimulator routeSimulator` field from [Header("UI References")]
- Removed RouteSimulator finding logic in `Awake()`
- Removed RouteSimulator event subscription in `Start()`
- Removed `OnSimulationCompleted()` method 
- Removed RouteSimulator setup in `SetupRouteNavigator()`
- Removed `SetRouteSimulator()` method
- Removed `GetRouteSimulator()` method
- Removed direct simulation control in `RecalculateRouteFromCurrentPosition()`

**Added Event-Driven Communication:**
- Added `OnNewRouteAvailable` event that fires with route points when a new route is calculated
- Modified both `CalculateRoute()` overloads to fire `OnNewRouteAvailable` event with route points
- Updated `OnDestroy()` to clean up the new event
- Added comments explaining that RouteSimulator will handle simulation via events

### 2. RouteNavigator Changes

**Removed Direct RouteSimulator Control:**
- Removed `RouteSimulator routeSimulator` field from internal references
- Removed RouteSimulator stopping logic in `HideRoute()`
- Removed `StartRouteSimulation()` method
- Removed `SetRouteSimulator()` method
- Removed `OnSimulationCompleted()` and `OnSimulationStopped()` event handlers
- Removed RouteSimulator event cleanup in `OnDestroy()`

**Updated Simulation Button Handler:**
- Modified `OnSimulatePopUpActionClicked()` to find RouteSimulator and call `StartSimulationManually()`

### 3. RouteSimulator Changes

**Added Event-Driven Control:**
- Added `RouteManager routeManager` field in [Header("References")]
- Added RouteManager finding and event subscription in `Start()`
- Added `OnNewRouteAvailable(List<Vector3> newRoutePoints)` event handler that stores route and conditionally starts simulation
- Added `OnRouteHidden()` event handler that stops current simulation
- Added `OnRouteRecalculated()` event handler that sets auto-start flag for recalculations
- Added `StartSimulationManually()` public method for manual simulation start
- Added state tracking (`hasSimulatedBefore`, `isRouteRecalculation`) to control auto-start behavior
- Updated `OnDestroy()` and `OnDisable()` to clean up event subscriptions

**Smart Simulation Logic:**
- **First Route**: Waits for user to click "Simulate Drive" button
- **Recalculated Routes**: Automatically starts (for course corrections)
- **Subsequent Routes**: Automatically starts after first manual simulation

### 4. TargetPositionController Changes

**Removed Direct RouteSimulator Control:**
- Removed direct RouteSimulator control in `SetTargetPosition()` method
- Updated to rely on event-driven architecture where RouteSimulator automatically stops when routes are hidden

## Architecture Benefits

### Before (Tight Coupling):
- RouteManager directly controlled RouteSimulator
- RouteNavigator directly controlled RouteSimulator  
- RouteManager/Navigator had to know about simulation lifecycle
- Mixed responsibilities between route calculation and simulation control

### After (Event-Driven):
- RouteManager only manages routes and fires events
- RouteNavigator only handles route visualization and UI
- RouteSimulator autonomously responds to route events
- Clear separation of concerns
- Loose coupling between components

### User Experience Fix:
- **Initial Route**: RouteSimulator waits for user to click "Simulate Drive" button
- **Route Recalculations**: RouteSimulator automatically follows new routes (for course corrections)
- **Subsequent Routes**: After first manual simulation, all future routes auto-start (seamless experience)

## Event Flow

### Initial Route (First Time):
1. **Route Calculation**: RouteManager calculates new route
2. **Event Fired**: RouteManager fires `OnNewRouteAvailable` event with route points
3. **Route Stored**: RouteSimulator stores route but waits for user input
4. **User Input**: User clicks "Simulate Drive" button
5. **Manual Start**: RouteNavigator calls `RouteSimulator.StartSimulationManually()`

### Route Recalculations (Course Changes):
1. **Course Change**: RouteManager detects course deviation
2. **Recalculation Event**: RouteManager fires `OnRouteRecalculated` event
3. **Auto Flag Set**: RouteSimulator sets `isRouteRecalculation = true`
4. **New Route Event**: RouteManager fires `OnNewRouteAvailable` event
5. **Automatic Start**: RouteSimulator automatically starts following new route

### Subsequent Routes (After First Manual Start):
1. **Route Calculation**: RouteManager calculates new route
2. **Event Fired**: RouteManager fires `OnNewRouteAvailable` event
3. **Automatic Start**: RouteSimulator automatically starts (because `hasSimulatedBefore = true`)

## Usage

The system now works automatically:
- When a route is calculated, RouteSimulator automatically starts following it
- When a route is recalculated (e.g., course change), RouteSimulator automatically switches to the new route
- When a route is hidden, RouteSimulator automatically stops
- No manual coordination needed between components

## Configuration

In the Unity Inspector:
- RouteManager: Remove RouteSimulator reference (no longer needed)
- RouteSimulator: Optionally assign RouteManager reference (will be found automatically if not assigned)

The system maintains full backward compatibility while providing better architecture.
